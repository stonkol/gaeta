## the naming

The earliest known use of the word "pizza" dates back to May 997 CE in a Latin document from **Gaeta**, then part of the Byzantine Empire. It records a tenant owing the bishop twelve pizzas, a pork shoulder, and kidney each Christmas, plus twelve pizzas and a couple of chickens each Easter Sunday.
